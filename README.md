## Number Guesser V1.0.0 (2020-03-12)
A small number guessing game web app! Try to see if you are a better number guesser than computer! 
At each round, a random number ("target") between 0 and 9 (inclusive) will be generated. What you do to win this game is trying to input a number that's as close as possible to the target! Your guess will be compared to that of computer (Note: If there is a tie, you win!). If you win, your score will increment by 1.

#### Release Notes
- Random number generator was used to simulate randomness (Uniform Distribution)
- You can click on "Next Round" button to go to next round
- User's input is ensured to be between 0 - 9.
